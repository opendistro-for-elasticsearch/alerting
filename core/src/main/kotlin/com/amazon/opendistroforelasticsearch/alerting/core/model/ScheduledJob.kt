/**

 *
 * All implementations of [ScheduledJob]s are stored in the [SCHEDULED_JOBS_INDEX] index and are scheduled in a
 * single global Scheduler running on each node. Each implementation should have its own separate APIs for writing,
 * updating and deleting instances of that job type into the [SCHEDULED_JOBS_INDEX] index. The index is periodically
 * scanned for updates which are then scheduled or unscheduled with the Scheduler.
 *
 * Like all documents in Elasticsearch [ScheduledJob]s also have an [id] and a [version].  Jobs that have not been
 * persisted in the cluster should use the special sentinel values [NO_ID] and [NO_VERSION] for these fields.
